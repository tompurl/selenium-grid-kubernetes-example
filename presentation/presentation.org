  - Likes to build cool things and share them with others
* What are We Doing Today?
  - Having fun?
  - Building a debug-able Selenium Grid against which we can run automated UI tests.
  - Learning a little about Kubernetes
* Related Code Repo
  - https://github.com/tompurl/selenium-grid-kubernetes-example
* Demo!
** Setting Up the Cluster
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - This will be done ahead of time
   - This is the "control plane", which seems to be a fancy way of saying an admin
     interface.
   #+END_NOTES
   Run the following script:
   - [[file:/ssh:david:/home/tom/src/selenium-grid-kubernetes-example/scripts/create-linode-k8s-cluster.sh][scripts/create-linode-k8s-cluster.sh]]
** Selenium Installation
*** kubectl - The Kubernetes Admin Command-Line Interface
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   - Many kubernetes systems don't provide a graphical UI by default
   - Only mature, vendor-independent interface
   #+END_NOTES
    - =kubectl= is a tool that runs on your client that administers your Kubernetes
      cluster.
    - Cross platform
    - Not vendor-specific
*** How We're Installing The System - Helm
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - Becoming a de-facto standard for package management
    - If Kubernetes is the "OS", then helm is the "package manager".
    - Far from perfect :-)
    #+END_NOTES
    - https://helm.sh/
    - Very popular tool for deploying complete systems on top of Kubernetes
*** What We're Installing - Selenium Grid
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - Don't worry if you don't know anything about automated testing or Selenium
    - This is a means to an end
    - Good beginner example because there's not state
    #+END_NOTES
    - https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/
    - Smart proxy for hosting web browser instances that can be driven using
      automated browser tests
*** How We're Configuring It
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - YAML is fhe config format.
    - The format of this file is specified mostly by the author of the Helm Chart.
    - *ClusterIP* means "create a service with a  private IP address"
    - If it was of type *LoadBalancer* then it would create a public-facing service.
    - =chromeDebug.enabled= means use the "debug" version of the Chrome Docker image.
    #+END_NOTES

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh :wrap src yaml :exports results :results code
      cat ../values.yaml
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    #+begin_src yaml
    hub:
      serviceType: ClusterIP
    chromeDebug:
      enabled: true
    firefoxDebug:
      enabled: true
      replicas: 2

*** More Installation Options Here
    - https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable/selenium
*** Installation Command
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      # See https://github.com/tompurl/selenium-grid-kubernetes-example#configure-kubeconfig
      # for kubectl config steps.
      helm install selenium-test -f values.yaml stable/selenium
    #+END_SRC
** Kicking the Tires
*** Pods & Services
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      kubectl get pods
      kubectl get svc
    #+END_SRC
*** What's My App's Admin Interface URL?
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - View the private IP and port
    - "Manual" port-forwarding is a bit tricky
    - =kubectl= makes it easy
    #+END_NOTES

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 $HUB_POD 4444:4444
    #+END_SRC
*** Running the Tests
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - Tests are written using the Robot Framework
    - Show the code of one of the tests
    #+END_NOTES
    This test...
    - Opens a Chrome browser
    - Visits my home page
    - Sleeps a little so I can see what's happening :-)
    - Looks for the word "Datsun"
    - Closes the browser
*** Test Source Code
    - https://github.com/tompurl/selenium-grid-kubernetes-example/blob/master/tests/test1.robot
*** Running the Test
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - Visit the Selenium Hub URL
    #+END_NOTES

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      # Run tests
      make test
      # Check output
      firefox Output/log.html
    #+END_SRC
*** Debugging the Test
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      # Port forward the VNC port in window 1
      kubectl port-forward $HUB_POD 5901:5900
      # Connect to the port from window #2
      vncviewer localhost:5901
    #+END_SRC
** Throw It All Away :-)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     helm uninstall selenium-test
   #+END_SRC
